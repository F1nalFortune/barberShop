               to keep your head above the water, never give up. The key is to

               believe. When you believe, you will succeed. Lion! The first of the
               month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost
               money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. Celebrate success
               right, the only way, apple. Give thanks to the most high. Surround

              Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! The ladies always say
              Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. To
              succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. You
              should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life,
              we breathing, we blessed. Put it this way, it took me twenty five
              years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and
              tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started.
